# program: run_analysis
# author: matt connock
# 
# purpose of program is to merge a set of test and training data with the relevent subjects and activities.
# activities should be referenced by name rather than id to provide a descriptive data set.
# one the data sets are merged the mean should be calculated for all measures relating to mean and std deviation.
#
# read files into data structures
